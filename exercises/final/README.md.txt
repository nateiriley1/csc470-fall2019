Plan
-The game will have 5 levels(like rooms),  it will be a mix of making choices at the beginning of a level, and a dungeon crawler in the first person. 
-This game will be used with a mouse and a keyboard. 
-The visual style will be as simple as some basic color design patterns. 
-The audio style of the rooms will be a range of EDM and each level will have its own song. 
-The story will be about escaping a dungeon and the players will have to make decisions about certain things(I don’t know yet maybe items or just some dialogue), and throughout the game, each decision you make will change the path a person might go on. And each one might just have a text ending telling a different scenario each time. It will also have a futuristic style to it overall.

The Low-Bar
- The low bar will at least 3 levels and if there is very little time to complete, then it will go to 8 endings instead of going to the last level. 
-The visual style the same as above. 
- Audio will have some basic songs and the animations will have sounds effects for like doors and other things like that. 
- The story would be the same as the Plan above, but with fewer choices and fewer endings. 

The Target
-The target will be to finish at least 4 levels and the number of endings will be at least 16 endings. 
-The visual style will have the decor in it but still, include a symbol art design. 
- Each floor will have its own audio and the song will some type of EDM. 
-The story will get more endings and more choices because of the added level. 

The High-Bar
-The high bar will have 5 levels and the number of endings will be 32 and secret ending(This is the best-case scenario).
-The visual style of each floor will look different from each other(Maybe having each room run a random seed of the room layout. 
-The audio will be the same as The Target’s because there is nothing more I want to do with the audio.
-The story will get more endings and more choices because of the added level.
